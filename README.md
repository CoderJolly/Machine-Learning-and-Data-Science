# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science

## Overview
This is a repository which contains all my work and experience with machine learning, AI and data science. I am an aspiring data scientist and have learnt that the only way to learn the techniques and methods of anything is to get your hands dirty by doing lots of projects. This repo is my attempt to learn what I am the most passionate about: **AI, ML and Data Science**. The repository is structured as follows:
